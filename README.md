# comics-shortcut
If you have the opportunity to continue working on this project, you may want to consider adding the ability to search for comics by text, as well as implementing the persistent functionality of Core Data. You could also consider adding additional features or functionality to the app, such as the ability to save favorite comics or share them with others. Finally, you may want to consider refactoring or reorganizing the code to make it more maintainable and scalable.
